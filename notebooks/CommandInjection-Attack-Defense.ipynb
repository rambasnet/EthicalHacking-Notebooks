    "# Command Injection Vulnerability, Attacks and Mitigations\n",
    "\n",
    "## Environment Variables Pitfalls\n",
    "- there's no known inherent vulnerability on environment variables\n",
    "- like many features of OSes, they just provide a convenient way to manage configuration settings\n",
    "\n",
    "### Security Risks\n",
    "- env vars are accessible by processes on the system; means that sensitive information stored in them such as API keys or database credentials could potentially be exposed if proper security measures not in place\n",
    "\n",
    "### Accidental Overwriting\n",
    "- since env vars are dynamic and can be changed at runtime, there's a risk of accidental overwriting\n",
    "- a misconfigured or malicious process might alter the values of critical variables, leading to unexpected behavior of applications\n",
    "\n",
    "### Debugging Challenges\n",
    "- in complex systems, tracing the source of a problem can be difficult\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dependency on External Configuration\n",
    "- overreliance on environment variables for configuration settings can make it challenging to manage and version configurations, esp. in larger projects\n",
    "- changes in configruations may require updates in multiple places, leading to potentital inconsistencies\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lack of Encryption\n",
    "- environment variables are typically stored in plaintext\n",
    "- sensitive information if stored as env vars can be exposed\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limited Access Control\n",
    "- access control on env variables are ususally limited\n",
    "- it can be challenging to ensure proper access control to preven unauthorized access and modification to sensitive variables\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hard-Coding Pitfall\n",
    "- care should be taken to access the hard-coded env vars in programs\n",
    "- what if the values of the variables are modified by the malicios programs and processes?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Environment Variables Exploitation Demo\n",
    "\n",
    "- `today.cpp` program in `demos/envexploit` folder uses `system` API to rely on PATH variable to call date function\n",
    "- can we force this program to read `/etc/passwd` file without modifying the program itself?"
